# OxyPlot.Eto

[![NuGet](http://img.shields.io/nuget/v/OxyPlot.Eto.svg?style=flat)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/OxyPlot.Eto/)

This is a port of the WindowsForms backend of [OxyPlot](https://github.com/oxyplot/oxyplot) to [Eto.Forms](https://github.com/picoe/Eto). It does not require any native controls and therefore should run on all platforms supported by Eto.  
This project is forked from https://github.com/mostanes/OxyPlot.EtoForms.
